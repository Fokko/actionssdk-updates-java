# Actions on Google: Updates API sample using Java and Cloud Firestore for Firebase

This sample shows an Action that gives tips about developing Actions for the Google Assistant using Actions on Google.

### Setup Instructions

#### Action Configuration
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), add a new project (this will become your *Project ID*) > **Create Project**.
1. Scroll down and click **Actions SDK**.
1. [Install the gactions CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli) if you haven't already.

#### Enable the Actions API
1. Visit the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for the project used in the [Actions console](https://console.actions.google.com).
1. Navigate to the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).
1. Search for and enable the Google Actions API.
1. Navigate to the Credentials page in the API manager.
1. Click Create credentials > Service Account Key.
1. Click the Select box under Service Account and click New Service Account.
1. Give the Service Account the name (i.e. "service-account") and the role of Project Owner.
1. Select the JSON key type.
1. Click Create.
1. Place the newly downloaded file in the 'src/main/resources/' directory calling the file `service-account.json`.
1. In the `src/main/resources/config.properties` file of the project, update the value of the `project_id` field with the project ID of your newly created project (no quotes).

#### Setup Cloud Firestore for Firebase
1. Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and select the project that you have created on the Actions on Google console.
1. Click the gear icon, then select *Project settings* > *SERVICE ACCOUNTS*.
1. Generate a new private key and save it in the `src/main/resources/` directory calling the file `firebase-service-account.json`.
1. On the left navigation menu under *DEVELOP*, click on *Database*.
1. Under *Cloud Firestore Beta*, click *Create database*.
1. Select *Start in test mode*, click *Enable*.

#### Configure updates and push notifications
1. Go to the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com).
1. Follow the *Console Setup* instructions in the [Daily Updates](https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant/updates/daily) and the [Push Notifications](https://developers.google.com/actions/assistant/updates/notifications) documentation to enable daily updates and push notifications.

#### App Engine Deployment & Webhook Configuration
When a new project is created using the Actions Console, it also creates a Google Cloud project in the background.

1. Download & install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)
1. Configure the gcloud CLI and set your Google Cloud project to the name of your Actions on Google Project ID, which you can find from the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com/) under Settings âš™
   + `gcloud init`
   + `gcloud auth application-default login`
   + `gcloud components install app-engine-java`
   + `gcloud components update`
1. Deploy to [App Engine using Gradle](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-gradle):
   + `gradle appengineDeploy` OR
   +  From within IntelliJ, open the Gradle tray and run the appEngineDeploy task.
1. Modify the `action.json` file included in the project, replacing the placeholder fulfillment URL with the URL to your fulfillment.
1. Run the command, adding in your project_id `gactions update --action_package action.json --project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`.

### Testing this Sample
1. In the [Actions on Google console](https://console.actions.google.com), select the project that you have created for this sample.
1. On the left navigation menu under **TEST**, click on **Simulator**.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to Google Assistant on a mobile device associated with your Action's account.
1. To test daily updates, choose a category. After the tip, the app will show a suggestion chip to subscribe for daily updates. Once a user is subscribed, they will receive update notifications daily for the time they specified.
1. To test push notifications, choose to hear the most recent tip. After the tip, the app will show
a suggestion chip to subscribe for push notifications. To send a push notification to all subscribed users, type "send notification" at any point during the conversation.
